      title: "Pascal/Delphi Compiler to LLVM IR & WebAssembly",
      description: "Developed a Pascal/Delphi compiler in Java using ANTLR4, extending Pascal grammar to support object-oriented programming, control flow constructs, and user-defined procedures/functions; progressed a static scoping AST visitor to perform semantic analysis and generate optimized LLVM IR, reducing IR size by 25% and improving semantic validation accuracy to 99%. Compiled LLVM IR to WebAssembly using the LLVM toolchain, achieving 25% code size reduction and 99% semantic accuracy; perfected an HTML+JavaScript runtime to load and execute Pascal programs directly in browsers.",

      title: "Smart Resume Analyzer",
      description: "Forged a cloud-based resume analysis web application using React, TypeScript, and Fast API backend, furnishing real-time skill matching scores and missing skill recommendations through NLP, reducing recruiter screening time by 20 hours weekly. Applied SpaCy NLP preprocessing (lemmatization, stopword removal) to improve matching accuracy by 30% compared to baseline keyword search models. Implemented CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions, Designed scalable RESTful APIs with 99% uptime during testing, optimizing frontend load times by 40% using Vite build optimizations.",

      title: "Amino Acid Sequence Function Prediction",
      description: "Built a multi-label protein function prediction model using TensorFlow and pre-trained ProtT5 embeddings, classifying 5,000+ functions from the CAFA 5 dataset. Trained the model on an NVIDIA V100 GPU for 20 epochs with binary cross-entropy loss, achieving 87.4% AUC and strong generalization using a 20% validation split. Optimized the model pipeline for efficiency by freezing transformer layers and implementing resource-aware preprocessing to reduce memory and training time.",

      title: "Network-based Chat Application with File Transfer",
      description: "This project is a Java-based multithreaded chat application that enables real-time, peer-to-peer communication and file transfer over TCP sockets. Designed using Java's ServerSocket and Socket APIs, the system operates with two concurrent threads: one for reading incoming messages and another for writing and sending messages or files. Users can exchange text messages seamlessly and initiate file transfers using a command-based protocol (transfer <filename>), which transmits files in 1KB chunks to ensure reliable delivery. The application features robust I/O handling, validates byte-level data integrity, and supports clean socket shutdown.",

      description: "Developed an abstractive text summarization model leveraging a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with attention mechanisms, achieving a ROUGE-1 score of 41.2 on benchmark news datasets. Engineered a custom data preprocessing pipeline (including tokenization, padding, and outlier filtering) that reduced input noise by 28%, leading to improved model convergence and 20% faster training times. Implemented beam search decoding for summary generation, improving output fluency and coherence by 15% compared to standard greedy decoding techniques.",

      description: "Designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) using transfer learning with ResNet-50, achieving 92.6% validation accuracy across a curated dataset of 10,000+ labeled aerial images. Implemented a dynamic data augmentation pipeline (random crops, flips, rotations) via PyTorch, improving model robustness and reducing overfitting by ~23% compared to non-augmented training. Optimized the model for low-latency inference, achieving an average prediction time of 47 ms per frame on standard GPU hardware, enabling real-time aerial monitoring applications.",

Optimized file I/O operations with binary serialization techniques, improving data retrieval and storage efficiency by ~40% compared to naive text-based methods. Developed a menu-driven command-line interface (CLI) enabling real-time transaction processing with 100% data persistence across sessions using structured file storage.",
